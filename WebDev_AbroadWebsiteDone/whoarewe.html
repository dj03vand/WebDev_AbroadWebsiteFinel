       <h2>Who are we?</h2>
       <p> Right now it is more of a "who am I". My name is Daniel Van Dyk and currently I am enrolled in Corvinus University of Budapest abroad. In fact I am sitting in the first floor of the new building and freezing my ass off. I am from upstate New York which is honeslty more similar to Vermont than anything else. My home university is Siena College in The United States where currently I am working on my major in computer science and information systems. I want to share with you the journey I had to where I am right now.   ps. To the right are a few of my favorite pictues from traveling abroad.</p><br>
       
       <h2>The struggle.</h2>
       
       <p>Going into my Junior year I was feeling really discouraged about my acedemics. At the time I was a finance major and a computer science minor ( my advisors had explained it was unrealistic to switch majors at the start of junior year). I had spent a good portion of that previous summer break to plan my study abroad experience in South Africa. I just wanted to get out of the current college atmosphere for awhile, I was falling into the repition of school, andI was sad thinking it was too late to major in computer science. I applied for a visa and had everything sorted out with my home instutution, financially and also which classes I would take in Stellenbosh, South Africa. It seemed like everyone in my class was planning on going abroad as well. Unfortunatley I had not been in the greatest disciplinary standing at my University (fighting, drinking, hospital visits, weed ect.) many of my personal freinds had been kicked out of the university and it always seemed like I was connected to their trouble in some way. I even watched my brother was tackled and tranquilzed the day he was kicked out. In fact I had been on probation since fest semester freshman year and most of the Deans and public saftey officers knew me on a first name basis. The plan was to stay out of trouble for the one semester before I could go abraod in the Spring.
       Finally it was the day for me to be caught. One of my best friends at school and I were rolling up before we went to go out for the night, public saftey started banging on the door and we both jumped out the window. Other details cant be explained because cops were also involved for other reasons but I obviously dont want to penalized for this article. This led to meetings with the dean of students where my probation was contiued into the next semster.You would think at this time I would be informed I was kicked out of the abroad program but my university had other plans. After recieveing verbal confirmation from the dean that she would conact the study abroad office and see what my future would entail, I was immediatley filled with mixed emotions as I just escaped expulsion from the university based on inconclusive drug tests, my abroad experience seemed impossible at this point. I had many meetings with the dean after which solidified my required attendance to substance abuse classes. I went through the motions of that on top of school which was rough but to my amazement I had not been called in to my study abroad office with any negative news. I continued to meet up with my abroad office and dean of students periodically, completing my abroad and disciplinary requitements. I remember the moment I sat down in the handicapped bathroom crying to my mom over the phone, I was rejected from the abroad program, I was called into the office for a maybe 2 minute meeting where they simply told me they had not been informed by the disciplinary department or dean of my not-so-recent incident. The previous day the dean told me that I had to keep attending substance abuse classed throughout the winter break, and I didnt know how that would work because I do not live close to my university. She opted to, which was in the FIST time she had talked to the study abroad office (she had since october 24th and it was currently the end of november), send a email and ask how I could take the classes in leu of going to South Africa. I was depressed, I cried more than most people know, and now I sat back while my girlfriend and around 50% of my best freinds posted to social media how much fun they were having for the next four months. The emotional pain of being so close and immedeatly shut down out of the blue took its toll. Getting out of bed became a chore, I got shafted in all my classes because I had not registered/planned to be at my home university, it was a huge pain in the ass and nothing ever went right.</p><br>
       
       <h2>
        The change.
       </h2>
      <p> I had immersed myself in school to get my mind off of studying abroad, but it never left. Eventually I mustered the courage to ask a second chance from my university and it was decided that if I went the entire semester without any disciplinary action I would be able to go abroad (that had never happened before). Literally at this point a lot of my life turned around. I stopped going out everyday of the weekend to drink and forget my problems, my GPA was the highest of any semester and I made the bold descision to stay at college for a 5th year and persue my major in computer science. On the surface it seemed like the new lifestyle formed from my rejection and was completley forced, and honestly that is what it felt like initally. My university yes was screwing me over like the dozens of others I could name. What did happen was it created a drive inside me to prove them wrong, I knew they thought I would fail because of my disciplinary history but I knew I wouldnt, I was not going to do anything to mess up the only other chance I had in my time at University.</p><br>
      
      <h2>
        The forever.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am nearing the end of my time studying in Budapest and finals are approaching, it is currently November 30th and I get on the plane home December 16th. The time I have had here was extrordinary. I will tell you in my own profile later when I create one on this site about anything and everything that happened over here. I know not everyone has such an elaborate background on why their abroad experience meant so much to them, but heres my story. If everyone in our study abroad community shares themselves you really will relate to someone else in the world. Personally if I can influence just one person and direct them to the life changing experience I have had, its a sucsess. In our community no one is alone.
